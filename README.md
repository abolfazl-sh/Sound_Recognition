# Sound_Recognition
Urban sound recognition by deep learning and TensorFlow
In this project, first of all, I have extracted the spectrogram of urban's sound by Matlab.
After that, I have used Tensorflow to implement a CNN and train it by spectrograms.
After all? We have a model that recognizes sounds with 78% accuracy.
